# HYBRID EXPLAINER EVALUATION SUMMARY

## Dataset
- Total Alerts Analyzed: 5
- Alert IDs: 44163, 57367, 90543, 95744, 136318

## Overall Performance Metrics

### Explanation Quality
- **Causal Coverage**: 40.00% (avg % of top features with causal paths)
- **Completeness**: 100.00% (has XAI + Causal + Recommendations)
- **Complementarity**: 60.00% (XAI and Causal provide different insights)
- **Actionability**: 100.00% (has specific recommendations)

### Information Density (Higher = More Information)
- XAI-Only: 0.50
- Causal-Only: 0.10
- **Hybrid: 0.53** 
  → 6.0% more than XAI-Only

### Feature Coverage
- Average Present Features: 42.0/42 (100.0%)
- Average Missing Features: 0.0/42 (0.0%)

### Causal Analysis
- Average Causal Paths per Alert: 1.0
- Alerts with Causal Paths: 5/5 (100.0%)

### Recommendations
- Average Recommendations per Alert: 4.6
- Range: 4-5 recommendations

### Severity Distribution
- MINIMAL: 3/5 (60.0%)
- LOW: 2/5 (40.0%)

## Key Findings

### 1. Hybrid Approach Provides Comprehensive Explanations
- ✅ All alerts (5/5) have XAI feature importance
- ✅ 5/5 alerts have causal paths
- ✅ All alerts (5/5) have actionable recommendations
- ✅ All alerts (5/5) have severity assessments

### 2. Complementarity Between XAI and Causal
- Average complementarity: 60.00%
- This indicates XAI and Causal analysis focus on **different aspects** of the alert
- XAI: Protocol-specific features (HTTP, TLS)
- Causal: Root causes (SignatureMatchesPerDay, SignatureID)

### 3. Information Gain Over Baselines
- Hybrid provides **5.3x** more information than Causal-Only

### 4. Causal Coverage Gap
- Average causal coverage: 40.00%
- This reflects the deliberate design choice: only 10 features in causal graph
- Top XAI features (protocol-specific) often not in causal graph

## Comparison: Hybrid vs XAI-Only vs Causal-Only

| Criterion | XAI-Only | Causal-Only | Hybrid | Winner |
|-----------|----------|-------------|--------|--------|
| Feature Importance | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | Tie |
| Causal Paths | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Tie |
| Root Causes | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Tie |
| Recommendations | ❌ No | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | **Hybrid** |
| Severity Assessment | ❌ No | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | **Hybrid** |
| Information Density | 0.50 | 0.10 | 0.53 | **Hybrid** |
| Actionability | Low | Medium | High | **Hybrid** |

## Strengths

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Combines "what" (XAI) with "why" (Causal)
2. **Actionable Guidance**: Specific recommendations for each alert
3. **Severity Context**: Accounts for dataset imbalance (1.5% vs 98.5%)
4. **Missing Value Handling**: Filters protocol-specific features appropriately
5. **Root Cause Tracing**: Identifies SignatureMatchesPerDay, SignatureID as root causes

## Limitations

1. **Causal Coverage Gap**: Only 40.0% of top XAI features have causal paths
2. **Graph Size Constraint**: 10-feature causal graph vs 42-feature XAI space
3. **Protocol-Specific Features**: HTTP, TLS features not in causal graph by design
4. **Limited Diversity**: All alerts predicted as Important (model bias toward minority class)

## Recommendations for Future Work

1. **Expand Causal Graph**: Include protocol-specific features in causal discovery
2. **Temporal Context**: Add time-based features to distinguish benign patterns
3. **User Validation**: Conduct SOC analyst study to validate explanation quality
4. **Adaptive Recommendations**: Context-aware recommendations based on alert history
